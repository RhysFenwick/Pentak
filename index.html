    <h2>Pentak</h2>
    <p>
        Popular among the sailors of Lhazaar, this game represents a naval battle between two fleets for control of an island chain.
    </p>
    <h4>Rules</h4>
    <p>
        Each player takes it in turn to move a piece. You can't move onto or over islands (dark green), or through other ships (even your own). Move onto your opponent's ships to sink them.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three ship types:
        <br>&#9956 Flagship - Fast and powerful. Moves up to five hexes in a line.
        <br>&#9876 Brig - Slow but strong. Moves one hex, but can't be sunk by a sloop.
        <br>&#9884 Sloop - All-rounder. Moves up to two hexes in a line.

    </p>
    <p>
      You can win one of two ways:
      <br>1. Wiping out your opponent's fleet, or
      <br>2. Having ships in 3 of the 4 island bays (light green) while your opponent has none.
